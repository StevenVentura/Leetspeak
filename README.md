# Leetspeak
Immature trolling tool for World of Warcraft

In September 2015 I made an addon for WoW that changes your text to one of 3 types of leetspeak. 

It is an in-game addon written in Lua scripting language. It has a GUI to allow you to choose the speech conversion type.

See https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/leetspeak for more information.
